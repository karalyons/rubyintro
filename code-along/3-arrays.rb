# Arrays are lists of things

# puts shopping_list

# Accessing the array
# puts favorite_foods[0]
# puts favorite_foods[1]
# puts favorite_foods[2]
# puts favorite_foods[3]
# puts favorite_foods[4].inspect
# puts favorite_foods[300].inspect
# puts favorite_foods[-1].inspect

# Add to the array

# favorite_foods.push "coffee" #.push or .append are the same or <<
#     puts favorite_foods;

# ! puts favorite_foods + "coffee"

puts shopping_list[1][0]
