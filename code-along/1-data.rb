# # To run this code, be sure your current working directory

# # ruby 1-data.rb

# # In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# # Numbers
# puts 5;
# puts 2;

# puts 5 + 2;
# puts 5 - 2;
# puts 5 * 2;
# puts 5 / 2;
# puts 5 % 2; #modulus for remainder

# #puts 5.0 / 2.0;

# puts 5.0 / 2;

# puts 5 * (2 + 1);
 
# Perform simple math with numbers

# Strings
# puts "Hello, world!";

# # Combine strings together
# puts "Tacos are" +" delish";
# puts "Tacos" * 3;
# # puts 3 * "Tacos"; does not work
# puts "Tacos " + 3.to_s;

# # Variables
# food = "Tacos"
# quantity = 3
# puts food * quantity;

# Combine strings and variables
first_name = "Tom"
# puts "Hello, " + first_name + "!";

greeting = "Hello, #{first_name}!"
